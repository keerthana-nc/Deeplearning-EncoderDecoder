# Deeplearning-EncoderDecoder
The Encoder-Decoder model handles the limitations posed by LSTM

An LSTM encoder-decoder model is a type of neural network where an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network processes an input sequence to capture its meaning and then uses that information to generate a new output sequence. It's like a translator: the encoder understands the "language" of the input, while the decoder uses that understanding to create something new in another "language."
